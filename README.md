Click a link to download every image in a 4chan thread.


NOTE: If you have the "Ask where to save each file before downloading" option 
enabled in Chrome's settings, Chrome will open a "Save As" dialog for every 
image in the thread, which may cause Chrome to crash. Please consider disabling 
that option to use this extension, or temporarily disabling it when you wish to 
download a thread.
